As promised, some shots of my solar (self-made) installation.

Running 4 - 5 years straight powering full home office and TV, vacuum cleaning.

Drilling a hole in plexiglass: A method for getting the cable from the outside to the inside without the draft. The (american-style vertical sliding) window then closes on the plexiglass.

2400Wh (2.4kWh) [Xantrex](http://www.xantrex.com/power-products/backup-power/xpower-powerhub-1800.aspx) battery, controller and 1800W (1.8kW) inverter in action.


Total cost on installation date: $4,386.38

Sunboxlabs's take
==================

This is a very heavy-duty system which can serve much bigger wattages than anything else on this site: It can make 3.6x as much energy with it's panels, store 5.7x as much energy in its' batteries, and give off the energy at 18x the rate than my little room kit. Impressive!

Also note that submitter has a very smart solution for getting his cable through his window and bridging the cold gap: making a hole in transparent plexiglass!

Finally, luckily the price has massively declined in the past few years: While 4 years ago the installer paid $4,386.38, it is now available for $1284.04. See below for newly researched links.
