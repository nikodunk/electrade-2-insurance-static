# Why Electrade?

According to 2018 data, insurance premium for electric vehicles range from $1600 - over $5,000 per year, about 19% above the national average and 16% above California average. Insurance carriers are calculating the premiums based on the level of risk they are exposed to, but data shows that electric vehicle owners are not only safer drivers, but also file less non accident related claims.


Additionally, EVs are safer vehicles to drive, usually equipped with high tech collision avoidance systems, autopilots, tracking devices and other safety features. Then the question is that why insurance companies charge higher premium for vehicles that are less risky to insure? Because the carriers do not understand the risk enough to properly underwrite these policies. We are providing insurers with the data they need in order to be able to package the right products tailored to the needs of EV owners at a price that makes EV ownership less costly and more convenient!
