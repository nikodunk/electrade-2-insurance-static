Running 4 -5 years straight powering  full home office and TV, vacuum cleaning.

Sunboxlabs's take:

Submitter has a very smart solution for getting his cable through his window: making a hole in transparent plexiglass! This is a very heavy-duty system which can serve much bigger Wattages than anything else on this site. Impressive!
