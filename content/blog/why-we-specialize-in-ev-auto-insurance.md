It's been covered broadly that electric cars are more expensive to insure, and this is one of the roadblocks still holding up EV adoption in 2019. And yet, the hardest part has been done – the hardware is here and performant, they are safer, cheaper to own than comparable gas cars, and by 2025 EVs will be cheaper to buy outright than internal combustion vehicles.
