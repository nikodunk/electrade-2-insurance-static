### Why the shareholder meeting brought ads to the center again

At the shareholder meeting yesterday 3+ shareholders mentioned the amount of disinformation around on the web regarding Tesla, and how maybe it was time to re-think the company's "We don't make ads – happy customers are the best marketing" stance. He even seemed convinced (see the second-last comment question below and especially how Mr. Musk reacted to the final suggestion at 1:51:35).

Maybe we'll be seeing more active Tesla PR, advertising or commercials in the future? After all, iPhones didn't rely only on word-of-mouth propaganda in their march to success. The main counter-argument to this voiced during the shareholder meeting by Mr. Musk was that Tesla is already selling more than they can produce. On the other hand, better knowledge of the public may help the share price defend against shorts, which is arguably also [valuable in itself](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-bulls-vs-bears-elon-musk-model-3-demand-q2-2019/).

The final suggestion on the video above was even to run another fan-made competition. We thought this would be a good time to re-visit some of the best fan-made Tesla ads around.

## Modern Spaceship:

This is probably [one of the most publicly known commercials](https://www.usatoday.com/story/driveon/2014/03/18/tesla-1500-ad-musk/6584835/), and in our opinion one of the best, even if there was some [controversy](https://adage.com/article/agency-viewpoint/tesla-ad-cost-1-500/292345?ttl=1396551200) regarding it's "$1,500" price tag.

### Nikola Tesla commercial:

Also very popular with 115,000 views on Youtube.

### Autonomous Possibilities by Troy Nikolic
Suggested by Reddit user Kerrdawg02 on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/bzyhdx/best_fanmade_tesla_commercials_and_ads_so_far/), a less known ad that highlights some of Tesla's autonomous features.
