Many freshly-minted or experienced EV owners are getting quotes that are way higher than for similarly-valued ICE cars, while others are getting quotes that are lower. So is electric cars' auto insurance more expensive than similarly-priced gas cars?

##### In a word – no. In 2019 they cost the same or less to insure.
