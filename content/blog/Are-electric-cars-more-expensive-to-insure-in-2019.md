Many freshly-minted or experienced EV owners are getting quotes that are way higher than for similarly-valued ICE cars, while others are getting quotes that are lower. So is electric cars' auto insurance more expensive than similarly-priced gas cars?

##### In a word – no. In 2019 they cost the same or less to insure. 

The partially higher quotes is because they are still a "new" phenomenon for mainstream auto insurance companies and many agents at insurance companies don't YET know how to properly value them. There is nothing inherently more expensive about electric cars to insure. In fact, they are often and should also be [cheaper](https://electrade.app/blog/why-electric-vehicle-insurance/).

* Less likely to be in a crash
* Safer in a crash

##### 3. Know what makes up your quote. 
The agent you get on the line, the state you are in, and the company will all vary, even for the same driver, vehicle, history etc. But these common factors all have an influence. 

* Which ZIP you're in
* If you're in a city, electric car insurance is going to cost more
* Whether it's a used or new electric vehicle
* If you bought used, the original purchase price of your car
* Other things like whether you're married, have a degree, and how your car is financed
* Your EV model
