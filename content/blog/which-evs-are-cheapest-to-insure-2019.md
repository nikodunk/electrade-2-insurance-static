10. Tesla Model X
9. Tesla Model S
8. Tesla Model 3
7. BMW i3 - BMW's original foray into the EV space, it has not seen many updates since it's release in 2013. Luckily, it was way ahead of it's time back then, meaning that this first entry into the luxury segment is extremely popular to this day thanks to its carbon fiber interior, plenty of space for families, and futuristic looks. 
6. Hyundai IONIQ Electric - Hyundai's upgraded IONIQ Electric was always impressive for its efficiency. With an EPA-rated range of 124 miles on only a 28 kWh battery pack, it was the most efficient electric car ever rated by the EPA. Also available as a Hybrid, it's not an EV-only platform, but it's an extremely popular EV. Especially in California.
5. Hyundai Kona EV – The first crossover EV available in the states, it's $36,950 starting price is a great deal for the well-rounded performance, great acceleration and spacious first entry into the crossover EV space. This car has a great range too, and was released 2 years before the Model Y is widely available – having the EV crossover market all to itself in the meantime.
4. Volkswagen e-Golf – this one is barely making the cut, as it's being discontinued over the next few years. Production of VW's ID3 is ramping up in Germany as this is being written. 
3. Nissan Leaf - Starting at $30,680, the Nissan Leaf is a compact five-door hatchback electric car manufactured by Nissan and introduced in Japan and the United States in December 2010, followed by various European countries and Canada in 2011. It recently lost the title of best-selling EV of all time to the Tesla Model 3. Nissan was the first-mover, and now with the Nissan Leaf e-Plus it has a car that has the full 200 mile range necessary to compete with the current line-up.
2. Kia Soul EV - 
1. Fiat 500e

Note: we are not including discontinued EVs like Mitsubishi i-MiEV, Ford Focus Electric, Smart Fortwo Electric Drive, as they're not longer actively being sold.
