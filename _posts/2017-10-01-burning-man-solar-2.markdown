Here is the much more portable and expensive version of <a href="/2017/06/20/200-apartment-solar-system.html">niko's</a> kit.

<a href="/parts.html#charles">See the parts list</a>

Anker PowerHouse to store the energy. 400 WH which is about the same capacity as the deep cycle battery listed, but this is lithium based so it's much lighter (9.3 lbs vs about 30 lbs for the deep cycle version). $500 

Foldable 80W solar panel. $190 

Extension cord for solar panel to battery. $8 

Evaporative Cooler instead of building your own. $112 

$810 for the total package. The benefits are that you get to use a lithium-based battery which is 20 lbs lighter, you can use a foldable solar panel which is more portable, and you buy a pre-assembled evaporative cooler which has nice features like swinging. Mainly this is a good solution for those that just want to press buttons and set up their configuration in a few hours otherwise the kit seems like a good option too.

I used this configuration at burning man and the battery was permanently charged even with the cooler on the whole time. I needed another shade structure for the tent to keep it down a couple more degrees but I was able to sleep until noon with this set up and be totally off grid and have enough power left over for lights and music.
