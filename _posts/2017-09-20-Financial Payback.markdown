Financial Payback
=================

How long until it saves me money?
The reason this system is so simple is because it doesn’t tie in to your apartment’s behind-the-meter electrical grid. This means the system is clean, but it also doesn’t feed into electrical heavyweights like your water heater, refrigerator and washer/dryer. It does charge anything you plug into it though. So can the system save me money? Back of the envelope:

	Financial payback period for 100W system
	System cost : $211 on Amazon
	Yearly energy creation: 365d * 4.26hsun/d * 100W = 155’490Wh/y
	Yearly value creation: 155kWh/y * 15.34c/kWh = $24/y energy created
	100W system payback period: $211 / $24 = 8.5 years until payback

The financial payback of the system is 9 years including battery, which is in line with many rooftop systems but doesn’t include servicing. This could be reduced to 6.5 years by adding a second 100W solar panel:

	Payback period for 200W system
	200W System cost: $300 on Amazon
	Yearly energy creation: 365d * 4.26hsun/d * 100W = 310’980Wh/y
	Yearly value creation: 311kWh/y * 15c/kWh = $48/y energy created
	200W system payback period: $300 / $48 = 6.5 years until payback

Note however that after 8 years of daily use the lead-acid deep discharge battery will be spent, which I’m not taking into account here. Either way you cut it, this is not a money saving machine. Energy prices are just too low.


How green is it?
Does it have an impact on my CO2 footprint? Back of the envelope:

	Production footprint PV multicristalline: 
	4200kWhee/kW [1] * 0.1kW = 420kWh embodied energy
	
	Production footprint lead-acid battery: 
	321kWhee/kWh [1] * 0.5kWh = 161kWh embodied energy

	Total Footprint: 581kWh
	
	Annual energy production system: 155kWh/y
	Payback period: 581kWh / 155kWh/y = 4+ year footprint payback

An eventual product would use Lithium-Ion batteries once they come down in price, which have a way better energy footprint. Lead-acid batteries are used for now because they’re cheap. So no, we’re not saving any CO2 emissions here until after 4 years — not a green machine.

Energy independence and resilience
In case of brownouts or blackouts, this would be a helpful way of wirelessly charging communications devices without the grid. A 200W system could even keep a small 60W, 12V refrigerator cool enough to conserve food (14hours of operation/day, cooling down 32 degrees below ambient temp). If energy prices increase (double? triple?) due to unforeseen events in the future, the financial perspective may even make sense with payback periods decreasing to four or even 2.8 years for the 100W system or for the 200W system to 3 years or 2 years, respectively. At under 2 years payback period, we’d be in similar consumer territory to 2-year phone contracts. Let’s hope components continue to get cheaper! (or energy prices increase — but I’d rather not hope for that)
