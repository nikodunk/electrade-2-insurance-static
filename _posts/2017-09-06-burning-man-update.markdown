I built a system for Burning Man 2017 in Nevada. It's a customized and improved version of Niko's system. We used it to run phones, fans, swamp coolers and lights.

The panel is mounted on top of the car at a fixed angle. The cables lead to back to the box next to the tent.

Next to the tent, the toolbox contains the battery, inverter and controller. Next to it is a swamp cooler and a cable leading into his tent (AC extension cable from the inverter in the box) powering another fan, chargers and lights.

Sean's running a great modified system – DC power goes to the swamp cooler's fan, the battery is laid into the tool tray. Plenty of extra space in this toolbox, which protects the system from dust and the sun.

Sean listed the main three reasons he decided to build his own system vs. bringing a diesel generator:

	* No Fuel Required
	* No Noise
	* Compact

"A <i>green</i> (his words) device with enough wattage to power a DC swamp cooler". He usually got 6 hours into the night before the battery was drained, but at that moment the sun came up and started generating energy again to power the swamp cooler.

We're going to add a box to the recommended kit, to give it a more rugged and finished look for outdoors and festival use.
