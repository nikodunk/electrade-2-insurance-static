Burning Man 2017 Update
===========

We found numerous burners who had built, customized and improved on the $200 solar self-sufficiency system at Burning Man in Nevada. They were being used to run phones, fans, swamp coolers and lights.

Attached Sean's great system:

The panel is mounted on top of the car at a fixed angle. The cables lead to back to the box next to the tent.

Next to the tent, the toolbox contains the battery, inverter and controller. Next to it is a swamp cooler and a cable leading into the tent for fans, chargers and lights.

Sean's running a great modified system – DC power goes to the swamp cooler's fan, the battery is laid into the tool tray. Plenty of extra space in this toolbox.

Sean listed the main three reasons he decided to build his own system vs. bringing a diesel generator:

	* No Fuel Required
	* No Noise
	* Compact

"A simple <i>green</i> (his words) system that's capable of running a DC swamp cooler (6 hours into the night, before the sun comes up and charges the battery again), charging his devices and running a fan inside his tent.""

We're going to add a box to the recommended kit, to give it a more rugged and finished look for outdoors and festival use.
