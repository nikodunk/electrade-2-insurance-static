The components
==============

![](/img/AMAZON.jpg)

My goal is to take care of the energy needs for just my bedroom. 4 main components are all we need to achieve this: A solar panel to collect, a battery to store, an inverter to convert the direct current to alternating current, and a “charge controller” to balance the three other components. I’m using bargain-basement parts intended for RV, marine & car usage which keeps my system cheap and mobile. Total component cost is $211 ($230 after shipping & taxes). The main components as found on Amazon are above.

I ordered the system on July 2nd, and with ground shipping the PV panel ($95) arrived July 11th from Canada, and the battery ($66), wiring ($18), controller ($17) and inverter ($15) arrived July 15th from Amazon USA.

Assembly
========
Hopefully you can adapt my system to your spatial situation pretty easily:

<b>Step 1</b> Cut and lay bare the end of the battery & inverter wires (battery disconnected, please). The panel’s wires are already bare on one end. Do a dry run connecting battery, inverter and panel to the controller — it should look like above.

<b>Step 2</b> Detach the panel wires again and place the panel on the rooftop or wherever you get the most sunlight (…garden …balcony …). Attach the panel to something: I zip-tied the back of the panel to a cable which I fastened on both ends around sturdy roof pipes...

...and run the power lines back to your apartment (drop down the facade and into the window in my case).

<b>Step 3</b> Assemble the solar controller, inverter and battery into a tighter package. Re-clamp the wire from the panel to the solar controller and close the window. It should look as above. The charge begins!

In the evening, turn on the inverter. My lamp, computer, tablet & phone are all being powered simultaneously here on the day’s solar charge! Self sufficiency achieved?
