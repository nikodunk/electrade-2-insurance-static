Wanting to build a small greenhouse with a solar panel. Been thinking about it for a while and haven't found any guides for a good combination of both. At least in my head, I'm thinking I'll have a panel on the south side of the greenhouse and have some batteries stored in the greenhouse. Use the power for any electronics and maybe even run wires back to the house (not too sure about that due to safety). 

Thoughts?
