A lot of questions we receive here are as to what you can charge and how far the energy will reach. I thought this would be worth a separate, more in-depth analysis. The findings from this article are now in the updated <a href="/parts.html" target="_blank">Parts List</a>

What adjustments would living off a single 420Wh system require of your lifestyle?
Worst energy culprits in my household are roughly in order of use: water heater, cooker, transportation, air heating, air cooling, fridge, dishwasher, washer/dryer, lighting. Living off 420wh a day requires replacing the culprits with lower-power parts (often intended for car, RV or marine use). At this point this project becomes very similar to the original inspiration for this article - Robin Rhineharts <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/08/op-ed-how-i-gave-up-alternating-current/" target="_blank">How I gave up alternating current</a> (Robin Rhinehart is the founder of Soylent). Replacing high-energy AC appliances with low-energy DC ones to stay within the 420Wh "budget".


Replacement thought-experiment:
* Transport - Car -> electric skateboard or ebike (though I prefer a bike to stay in shape).
* Heating - Central heating (oil furnace) -> electric car heater
* Cooling - Air Conditioner -> car fan
* Fridge - Refridgerator -> car fridge
* Light - Not really an issue. Already low power.
* Devices – Not really an issue. Already low power.
* Wifi – Not really an issue. Already low power (on the consumer side at least).

Things you can run off a single 420Wh "classic" system every day:

Transport | Heating | Cooling | Fridge | Light | Devices | Wifi

Electric Skateboard (or eBike) | Car heater | Car fan or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHbQYajfGqM" target="_blank">swamp cooler</a> | Car fridge | USB LED lights | MacBook Air, iPhone | Low power router
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
97Wh<br>(1 charge) | 300Wh<br>(2h * 150W) | 360Wh<br>(24h * 15W) |  420Wh<br>(60W * 7h) | 40Wh<br>(2 lights * 4W * 5h)	| 67Wh + 10Wh<br>(1 charge each) | 216Wh<br>(9W * 24h)

Note that all components above run on DC, so it's technically feasible to make just the cheaper DC-only system from the <a href="/parts.html">parts page</a>.

High-power components that have no low-power replacement yet:
* Water heating - No alternatives yet if we want hot showers, unfortunately.
* Cooking – Electric stove -> Gas stove - no low-power electric alternatives yet.
* Dishwasher - Wash dishes by hand. sorry y’all. 
* Washer/dryer - Hand wash and hang dry feasible? 

But what if we're not constrained to just 420Wh off a single system? This is where the componentization of the system comes in handy – we can just keep adding systems until our (reduced) power needs are covered by the panel+storage systems. How many systems would we need to run <i>all</i> of the devices above?

The total load for all the components in the theoretical off-grid apartment above is 1510Wh (or 1.51kWh). We'd need 4 systems to load all of the components every day and be completely off-grid in our apartment (or glamping or post-hurricane). Some compromises would be necessary like cooking with gas and washing by hand. The total cost would be around $800 (see <a href="/parts.html" target="_blank"> parts list</a>) – and payback would be around <a href="/2017/02/12/Financial-Payback.html" target="_blank"> 6.5 years</a> if we used it every day based on Californian electricity prices (@11c/kWh), or 4 years based on <a href="https://www.bls.gov/regions/new-york-new-jersey/news-release/averageenergyprices_newyorkarea.htm" target="_blank">20c/kWh in NY</a>.
