A lot of questions we receive here are as to what you can charge and how far the energy will reach. I thought this would be worth a separate, more in-depth analysis. The findings from this article are now in the updated <a onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'AffLink', 'clicked', 'Same Page');" href="/parts.html" target="_blank">Parts List</a>

What adjustments would living off a single 420Wh system require of your lifestyle?
Worst energy culprits in my household are roughly in order of energy use: hot water tank for showers, stove/kettle, transportation, air heating, air cooling, fridge, dishwasher, washer/dryer, lighting. Living off 420wh a day requires replacing the culprits with lower-power parts (often intended for car, RV or marine use). At this point this project becomes very similar to the original inspiration for this article - Robin Rhineharts <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/08/op-ed-how-i-gave-up-alternating-current/" target="_blank">How I gave up alternating current</a> (Robin Rhinehart is the founder of Soylent). Replacing high-energy AC appliances with low-energy DC ones to stay within the 420Wh "budget".


Low-power thought experiment: How could we replace devices to live within the 420Wh solar personal power plant budget?


<b>Lighting</b>
60W Incandescent Bulbs => 5W LED Lighting. Easy. Energy needed after: 2 lights * 4W * 5h = 40Wh/d

<b>Fridge</b>
300W Refridgerator => 60W Low-voltage 12V car fridge (smaller size), no freezer. Energy needed after: 60W * 7h = 420Wh/d

<b>Stove/kettle</b>
1200W Electric stove => 144W Low-voltage 12V car cooker. Heats things up to 300F – can cook rice, etc. Energy needed after: 144W * 1h = 144Wh/d

<b>Air Heating</b>
5600W Central heating (oil furnace) => 150W Low-voltage 12V car heater. Energy needed after: 2h * 150W = 300Wh/d

<b>Air Cooling</b>
<table style="text-align: center; margin: 0px; padding: 0px">
	<tr>
		<td><img src="/img/devices/ac.jpg" style="max-height: 200px"></td>
		<td><img src="/img/devices/evap.jpg" style="max-height: 200px"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px">
		<td style="width: 250px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-size: .8rem">1400W Air Conditioner</td>
		<td style="width: 250px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-size: .8rem">Replaced with a 45W Low-power evaporative cooler.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2">Energy needed after: 9h * 45W = 405Wh/d</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<b>Transport</b> 
Combustion transport => Electric skateboard/ebike (though I prefer a bike to stay in shape). Energy needed after: 1 charge = 97Wh/d

<b>Communication</b>
Laptop, Phone. Not really an issue. Already low power. Energy needed after: 1 charge each = 67Wh/d+10Wh/d


<br><br>See the actual components for this experiment <a onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'AffLink', 'clicked', 'Same Page');" href="/parts.html">here</a>. Note that almost all components above run on DC, so it's technically feasible to make the cheaper DC-only system from the aforementioned parts page.

High-power devices in my household that have no low-power replacement yet:
* Hot water tank: 4200W water heater => would be replaced with a solar water heater. This is a non-electric, purely mechanical system, similar to the system installed by Jimmy Carter on the white house in the 70s.
* Dishwasher: Dishwasher => Wash dishes by hand. Sorry y’all. 
* Washer/dryer: Washer/Dryer => Hand wash and hang dry feasible? 

But what if we're not constrained to just 420Wh off a single system? This is where the componentization of the system comes in handy – we can just keep adding systems until our (reduced) power needs are covered by the panel+storage systems. How many systems would we need to run <i>all</i> of the devices above?

The total load for all the components in the theoretical off-grid apartment above is 1510Wh (or 1.51kWh). We'd need 4 systems to load all of the components every day and be completely off-grid in our apartment (or glamping or post-hurricane). Some compromises would be necessary like cooking with gas and washing by hand. The total cost would be around $800 (see <a onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'AffLink', 'clicked', 'Same Page');" href="/parts.html" target="_blank"> parts list</a>) – and payback would be around <a href="/2017/02/12/Financial-Payback.html" target="_blank"> 8.5 years</a> if we used it every day based on Californian electricity prices (@11c/kWh), or 5 years based on <a href="https://www.bls.gov/regions/new-york-new-jersey/news-release/averageenergyprices_newyorkarea.htm" target="_blank">20c/kWh in NY</a>.
