A lot of questions we receive here are as to what you can charge and how far the energy will reach. I thought this would be worth a separate, more in-depth analysis. The findings from this article are now in the updated <a href="/parts.html" target="_blank">Parts List</a>

If you were to live off a single 420Wh system, what would this require?
Worst energy culprits in my household are roughly in order of use: water heater, cooker, transportation, air heating, air cooling, fridge, dishwasher, washer/dryer, lighting. Living off 420wh a day requires replacing the culprits with lower-power parts (often intended for car, RV or marine use). At this point this project becomes very similar to the original inspiration for this article - Robin Rhineharts <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/08/op-ed-how-i-gave-up-alternating-current/" target="_blank">How I gave up alternating current</a> (Robin Rhinehart is the founder of Soylent). Replacing high-energy AC appliances with low-energy DC ones to stay within the 420Wh "budget".

Replacement thought-experiment:
* Water heater - no alternatives yet for hot showers
* Cooker – Electric stove -> Gas stove - no low-power electric alternatives yet.
* Transport - Car -> electric skateboard or ebike (though I prefer a bike to stay in shape).
* Heating - Central heating (oil furnace) -> electric car heater
* Cooling - Air Conditioner -> car fan
* Fridge - Refridgerator -> car fridge
* Dishwasher - wash dishes by hand. sorry y’all. 
* Washer/dryer - hand wash and hang dry feasible? 
* Lighting - not really an issue. Already low power.
* Computing – not really an issue. Already low power.
* Internet – not really an issue. Already low power (on the consumer side at least).


Things you can run off a single 420Wh "classic" system every day:

Transport | Heating | Cooling | Fridge | Lighting | Computing | Internet

Electric Skateboard (or eBike) | Car heater | Car fan or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHbQYajfGqM" target="_blank">swamp cooler</a> | Car fridge | USB LED lights | MacBook Air, iPhone | Low power router
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
97Wh<br>(1 charge) | 300Wh<br>(2h * 150W) | 360Wh<br>(24h * 15W) |  420Wh<br>(60W * 7h) | 40Wh<br>(2 lights * 4W * 5h)	| 67Wh + 10Wh<br>(1 charge each) | 216Wh<br>(9W * 24h)

Note that all components above run on DC, so it's technically feasible to make just the cheaper DC-only system from the <a href="/parts.html">parts page</a>.

What if we're not constrained to just 420Wh off a single system? That'd be 840Wh or 1260Wh from 2 or 3 systems respectively. How many systems would we need to run <i>all</i> of the devices above?

Total is load is 1510Wh (or 1.51kWh). We'd need 4 systems to load all of the components every day and be completely off-grid in our apartment or while camping or after a hurricane (with some compromises like cooking with gas and washing by hand). The total cost for all of this would be around $800 (see <a href="/parts.html" target="_blank"> parts list</a>) – and payback would be around <a href="/2017/02/12/Financial-Payback.html" target="_blank"> 6.5 years</a> if we used it every day based on Californian electricity prices. 

This is where the componentization of the system comes in handy – we can just keep adding systems until our (reduced) power needs are covered by the panel+storage systems.
