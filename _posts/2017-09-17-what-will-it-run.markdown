A lot of questions we receive here are as to what you can charge and how far the energy will reach. I thought this would be worth a separate, more in-depth analysis. The findings from this article are now in the updated <a onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'AffLink', 'clicked', 'Same Page');" href="/parts.html" target="_blank">Parts List</a>

What adjustments would living off a single 420Wh system require of your lifestyle?
Worst energy culprits in my household are roughly in order of energy use: hot water tank for showers, stove/kettle, transportation, air heating, air cooling, fridge, dishwasher, washer/dryer, lighting. Living off 420wh a day requires replacing the culprits with lower-power parts (often intended for car, RV or marine use). At this point this project becomes very similar to the original inspiration for this article - Robin Rhineharts <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/08/op-ed-how-i-gave-up-alternating-current/" target="_blank">How I gave up alternating current</a> (Robin Rhinehart is the founder of Soylent). Replacing high-energy AC appliances with low-energy DC ones to stay within the 420Wh "budget".


Low-power thought experiment:
* Lighting - LED Lighting. Not really an issue. Already low power.
* Fridge - 300W Refridgerator -> 60W Low-voltage 12V car fridge (smaller size), no freezer.
* Stove/kettle – 1200W Electric stove -> 144W Low-voltage 12V car cooker. Heats things up to 300F – can cook rice, etc.
* Air Heating - 5600W Central heating (oil furnace) -> 150W Low-voltage 12V car heater
* Air Cooling - 1400W Air Conditioner -> 45W Low-power evaporative cooler
* Transport - Car -> Electric skateboard or ebike (though I prefer a bike to stay in shape).
* Communication – Laptop, Phone. Not really an issue. Already low power.

Low-power devices you can run off a single 420Wh "classic" system:

LED Light | Fridge | Stove/Kettle | Air Heating | Air Cooling | Transport | Communication

LED lights | Car fridge | Car cooker | Car heater | Evap. cooler | E-Skateboard (/E-Bike) | MacBook Air, iPhone

2 lights * 4W * 5h | 60W * 7h | 144W * 1h | 2h * 150W | 9h * 45W |  1 charge | 1 charge each

<b>40Wh/d</b> | <b>420Wh/d</b> |  <b>144Wh/d</b> | <b>300Wh/d</b>	| <b>405Wh/d</b> | <b>97Wh/d</b> | <b>67Wh/d+10Wh/d</b>

<br>See the actual components for this experiment<a href="/parts.html">here</a><br>

Note that almost all components above run on DC, so it's technically feasible to make just the cheaper DC-only system from the <a onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'AffLink', 'clicked', 'Same Page');" href="/parts.html">parts page</a>.

High-power devices in my household that have no low-power replacement yet:
* Hot water tank - No alternatives yet if we want hot showers, unfortunately.
* Dishwasher - Wash dishes by hand. Sorry y’all. 
* Washer/dryer - Hand wash and hang dry feasible? 

But what if we're not constrained to just 420Wh off a single system? This is where the componentization of the system comes in handy – we can just keep adding systems until our (reduced) power needs are covered by the panel+storage systems. How many systems would we need to run <i>all</i> of the devices above?

The total load for all the components in the theoretical off-grid apartment above is 1510Wh (or 1.51kWh). We'd need 4 systems to load all of the components every day and be completely off-grid in our apartment (or glamping or post-hurricane). Some compromises would be necessary like cooking with gas and washing by hand. The total cost would be around $800 (see <a onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'AffLink', 'clicked', 'Same Page');" href="/parts.html" target="_blank"> parts list</a>) – and payback would be around <a href="/2017/02/12/Financial-Payback.html" target="_blank"> 8.5 years</a> if we used it every day based on Californian electricity prices (@11c/kWh), or 5 years based on <a href="https://www.bls.gov/regions/new-york-new-jersey/news-release/averageenergyprices_newyorkarea.htm" target="_blank">20c/kWh in NY</a>.
