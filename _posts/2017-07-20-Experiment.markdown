One month of energy self-sufficiency in my room
===============================================

In San Francisco we get 4.26 hours of usable sunshine a day (or 1156 hours a year) according to Google Sunroof. My battery holds 420Wh (12V x 35Ah), and should be filled once a day without any shading. Actual production is an average 350Wh/day on the rooftop with real-world shading and loss.

	Daily Power Production:
	Theoretical: 4.26 sun hours/d * 100W solar = 426Wh/day
	Actual: 350Wh/day

	Daily Power Needs:
	54Wh Macbook Air 13-Inch (one charge a day)
	8Wh iPhone battery (one charge a day)
	20Wh Light (4W LED x 5h)
	300Wh Space Heater (150W x 2h – our SF house has no heating)
	___________
	
	Total: 82Wh energy need per day in room (up to 382Wh)`

This should be easily met by the solar system. I turn the inverter on when I get home to use AC lights and charge the Macbook through the power brick, and turn it off before I go to bed to avoid energy drain. My phone’s USB (which is direct current) can charge all night straight through the solar controller itself (which has USB ports) and doesn’t require the inverter. My laptop is a DC device and could be charged straight off the 12V battery, but I found it easier to just charge it with the AC power brick through the inverter.

My traditional AC lamp is a non-optimized part of the system— I could get DC lights that run off USB to avoid inverting that energy, but have not done so thus far and prefer to just use the cute little thing. When I go to bed I’ve usually used around 30% of the energy anyway— I wish I could run a water heater, heating or fridge off this system to use the excess 270Wh of the daily energy production.
