The components
==============

![](/img/AMAZON.jpg)

My goal is to take care of the energy needs for just my bedroom. 4 main components are all we need to achieve this: A solar panel to collect, a battery to store, an inverter to convert the direct current to alternating current, and a “charge controller” to balance the three other components. I’m using bargain-basement parts intended for RV, marine & car usage which keeps my system cheap and mobile. Total component cost is $211 ($230 after shipping & taxes). The main components as found on Amazon are above. Anyone looking to build a similar system themselves can view the full component list <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/cart/add.html?AssociateTag=gridlesskits-20&ASIN.1=B00L6LZRXM&Quantity.1=1&ASIN.2=B015DJ4QX4&Quantity.2=1&ASIN.3=B071FK3GWY&Quantity.3=1&ASIN.4=B01NAUV18K&Quantity.4=1&ASIN.5=B017PI2OUS&Quantity.5=1&ASIN.6=B000ND0WB6&Quantity.6=1" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'AffLink', 'clicked', 'Same Page');">here</a> (tweet your build <a href="http://twitter.com/gridlesskits" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'Twitter', 'clicked', 'Top');"" target="_blank">@gridlesskits</a>, how it went and what we can improve! We'll repost – and we'd love to know!). Or, you can  <a href="https://cash.me/$nikodunk" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'Reserve', 'clicked', 'Top');"> reserve a system</a> and we'll send you one pre-assembled in the mail.

I ordered the system on July 2nd, and with ground shipping the PV panel ($95) arrived July 11th from Canada, and the battery ($66), wiring ($18), controller ($17) and inverter ($15) arrived July 15th from Amazon USA.
